# Python_Challenges

This is my code from the three challenges "strings", "sumup" and "division" of week 4 including tests. The code runs in the command line. However, I get errors for "test_strings.py" and "test_division.py". I can't figure out what I did differently to "test_sumup.py". 

(You can ignore the file "sum.py", which is the challenge from week 1.
